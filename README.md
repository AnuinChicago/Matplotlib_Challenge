1.Drugs Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested 230 and 228 respectively. 

2. Drugs Capomulin and Ramicane show the most promising results. The tumor volume for these 2 drugs had the best reduction.

3. The corretaion between Mouse Weight and Average Tumor volume is 0.84, which is quite high. This means they both have a strong relationship with each other ie as weight increases the tumor growth is higher. This is also evident from the linear regression, y=0.95x+21.55. This shows that tumor volume increases by more that 21.
